            <span id="first">That's the way everyday goes</span> Every time we've no control
            If the sky is pink and white If the ground is black and yellow
            It's the same way you showed me Nod my head, don't close my eyes
            Halfway on a slow move It's the same way you showed me
            Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
            Gone off tabs of that acid Form me a circle, watch my Jagger <br>
            Might lose my jacket and hit a solo One time
            We too loud in public then police turned down the function
            Now we outside and the timing's perfect <br>
            Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
            And we don't gotta be solo
        </p>
