        <h3>Kill bill</h3>
        <p>
            I'm still a fan even though I was salty
            Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
            Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one driving
            I'm so mature, I'm so mature
            I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
            I don't want none, I just want you
            If I can't have you, no one should
            I might
            I might kill my ex, not the best idea
            His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
            I might kill my ex, I still love him though
            Rather be in jail than alone
            I get the sense that it's a lost cause
            I get the sense that you might really love her
            The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
            I tried to ration with you, no murders, no crimes of passion, but damn
            You was out of reach
            You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
            Now I'm in amazement, playing on my patience
            Now you laying face-down, got me singing over a beat
        </p>
